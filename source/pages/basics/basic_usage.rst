After you login to your account, you will be redirected to the homepage where you can quickly find the latest deposits and collections, start depositing your own data, or search for existing digital objects for download.

.. sidebar::
    **Note:**

    **Deposit** is an object containing one or more files and corresponding metadata

    **Collection** is a bunch of deposits and/or collections and has metadata of its own

    **Community** is a group of common users that are part of a research domain or initiative

    See :ref::`Objects <advanced-objects` for more information on object types.

The top region allows searching for deposits and collections immediately. It supports faceted search by prepending a field (e.g. 'title') before your search term, for example 'title:data'.

On the top right you can locate your account details and find some links in the dropdown menu when the avatar is clicked. The 'My account' option sends you to your `account page`_. Here you can easily start creating new deposits, collections, groups and, if allowed, communities and schemas.

On the buttom left column, the are  shortcuts for defining new collections, metadata schemas and groups, explained more in the :ref:`Advanced usage <advanced-usage>`.

The landing page of a deposit is created after completion of the online deposit workflow. In the deposit landing page you can see the deposit's basic details, additional metadata and information about the status of the files contained in the deposit, for example if the data is currently online or offline and therefore needs to be staged.

====================
Search and discover datasets
====================
To search for data use the search functionality on the home page. The text entered can be part of a title, keyword, abstract or any other metadata.

Both registered and unregistered users can search for data. You can also make search within specific communities, which means the search results will be limited to that community.

Advanced searches can be performed by clicking the Search button, then entering the additional search criteria on the page that is shown. You can set advanced search criteria to search for deposits, collections, schemas, communities or combinations of any of them. You can also order the search results by Title, Creator, Identifier, or Creation date.
