===================================
Introduction to the Data Repository
===================================

The Data Repository Service is a trusted digital repository that ensures long-term data preservation. The Data Repository provides an an online data publication platform service to share and publish research data. The aim of the service is to provide support for researcher to publish research data and to preserve published datasets for the long-term, thereby satisfying the requirements of publishers, financiers and (Dutch) science organisations regarding data publication. Furthermore, the user has complete freedom to decide on the structure, the metadata schemas, the designated community, and access levels of the published data.

There is a direct connection between the data repository service and other SURF services such as the Data Archive. All data in the data repository will eventually end up in the data archive for long-term storage and preservation. The repository is tape-aware, this means that data can automatically be put offline when it is not required for a certain amount of time.

This documentation is both for basic and advanced usage of the data repository service and also provides best practices for preparing your data and using the service.
