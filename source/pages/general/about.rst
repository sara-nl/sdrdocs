===================================
Introduction to the Data Repository
===================================

The Data Repository Service is a trusted digital repository that ensures long-term data preservation. The Data Repository provides an an online data publication platform service to share and publish research data. The aim of the service is to provide support for researcher to publish research data and to preserve published datasets for the long-term, thereby satisfying the requirements of publishers, financiers and (Dutch) science organisations regarding data publication. Furthermore, the user has complete freedom to decide on the structure, the metadata schemas, the designated community, and access levels of the published data.

There is a direct connection between the data repository service and other SURF services such as the Data Archive. All data in the data repository will eventually end up in the data archive for long-term storage and preservation. The repository is tape-aware, this means that data can automatically be put offline when it is not required for a certain amount of time.

This documentation is both for basic and advanced usage of the data repository service and also provides best practices for preparing your data and using the service.

=============
For what data
=============

The Data Repository service is especially suitable for publishing research data in the field of Big Data sciences. The repository imposes no limits on the data volume and number of files, but does have some guidelines on how to efficiently store your data for publication.

.. _get-access:

=================
How to get access
=================

You can get access to the service by contacting SURF via the `service desk`_. For large publications an agreement with your institute, research group or on an individual basis is required.

As soon as an agreement is in place, SURF will provision your account. If you already have an account for another service, it might be possible to use the same account. Once your account has been provisioned you can `login`_ to the service, :ref:`search for datasets <search-data>`, and make your :ref:`first deposit <deposit>`.
