Accessing the service
*********************

For basic functionality such as searching, discovery, and downloading of most datasets and collections registration is not required. For other functionality such as managing collections and depositing data an account is required. This page provides information on how to obtain an account and how to access the service.

How to obtain an account
========================

To get access to the service please contact SURF via the `service desk`_. For large publications an agreement with your institute, research group or on an individual basis is required.

As soon as an agreement is in place, SURF will provision your account. If you already have an account for another service, it might be possible to use the same account. Once your account has been provisioned you can access the service, :ref:`search for datasets <search-data>`, and make your :ref:`first deposit <deposit>`.

Logging in

You can log in to the service by visiting the website and clicking on the user avatar in the top-right corner. Fill in the credentials you have obtained from SURF in the `login page`_ of the service.

Once successfully authenticated, you can:

- Upload your own files and create deposits
- Manage existing deposits and other digital objects
- Select files for your basket and favourites
- Administer digital objects of other users that belong to your community (community administrator only)

Forgot password
