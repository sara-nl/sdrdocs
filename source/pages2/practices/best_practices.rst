==================
Preparing data
==================

To prepare data for a deposit you need to consider the following points:
- **File formats**
	- **Prefered formats** are file formats of which SURFsara is confident that they will offer the best long-term guarantees in terms of usability, accessibility and sustainability. Depositing research data in preferred formats will always be accepted by SURFsara. Here is a list with `SURFsara prefered formats`_ .

	- **Acceptale formats** are file formats that are widely used in addition to the preferred formats, and which will be moderately to reasonably usable, accessible and robust in the long term. SURFsara favours the use of preferred formats, but acceptable formats will in most cases also be allowed. Here is a list with `SURFsara acceptable formats`_ .

- **Files size**
	- **Maximum file size**: 4 GB using the online deposit form

	The maximum deposit data volume is 10 GB and the maximum number of files that can be uploaded via the onlone deposite is 10 files.
	
- **Data documentation**
	Data documentation ensures that research data are understood and therefore used by current and future users (including the researcher). It is vital to store the data in a structured and consistent way with appropriate data documentation. The documentation can be a text file explaining what the data is, what you can do with it and how it can be used.
	
- **Metadata**
	 Metadata provides structured information about the data. Depending on the type of data, there are different types of metadata:
	 - **Descriptive metadata** describes and identifies information resources (minimal metdata required to find a digital object). In includes elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords. 
	- **Structural metadata** provides information about the internal structure of resources including page, section, chapter numbering, indexes, and realtions to other digital objects.
	- **Technical metadata** provides information on the technical aspects of the datasets	 such as data formats, hardware/software used, calibration, version, authentication, encryption.
	- **Administrative metadata**	provides information on user rights and management of digital objects	 such as license, rights management,  and access control.
	
- **Data organisation**
	If you want your research data to be easily traced and interpreted, the folder structure and the file names used for the data files should be logical. Its also a good practice to note the file naming and its meaning in a readme.txt file.
 
- **Data anonymization**
	Before you upload the files you should check whether they contain privacy-sensitive information within the meaning of the `Dutch Personal Data Protection Act`_ . 
	If you give access to the data, they must be completely anonimyzed.
