## Logging inLogin with your user credentials in the [login page of the Data Repository Service] (https://tdr-test.surfsara.nl/user/login).## Preparing data 

To prepare data for a deposit you need to consider the following points:
- **File formats**
	- **Prefered formats** are file formats of which SURFsara is confident that they will offer the best long-term guarantees in terms of usability, accessibility and sustainability. Depositing research data in preferred formats will always be accepted by SURFsara. Here is a list with [SURFsara prefered formats] (http://datasupport.researchdata.nl/en/start-de-cursus/iii-onderzoeksfase/dataformaten/preferred-formats/)

	- **Acceptale formats** are file formats that are widely used in addition to the preferred formats, and which will be moderately to reasonably usable, accessible and robust in the long term. SURFsara favours the use of preferred formats, but acceptable formats will in most cases also be allowed. Here is a list with [SURFsara acceptable formats](http://datasupport.researchdata.nl/en/start-de-cursus/iii-onderzoeksfase/dataformaten/preferred-formats/)
- **Files size**
	- **Maximum file size**: 4 GB using the online deposit form
	- **minimu file size**: No minumum file size.

	The maximum data file size is 10 GB and the maximum number of files that can be uploaded via the onlone deposite is 100 files.
	- **Data documentation**	Data documentation ensures that research data are understood and therefore used by current and future users (including the researcher). It is vital to store the data in a structured and consistent way with appropriate data documentation. The documentation can be a text file explaining what the data is, what you can do with it and how it can be used.
	
- **Metadata**
	 Metadata provides structured information about the data. Depending on the type of data, there are different types of metadata:
	 - **Descriptive metadata** describes and identifies information resources (minimal metdata required to find a digital object). In includes elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords. 
	- **Structural metadata** provides information about the internal structure of resources including page, section, chapter numbering, indexes, and realtions to other digital objects.
	- **Technical metadata** provides information on the technical aspects of the datasets	 such as data formats, hardware/software used, calibration, version, authentication, encryption.
	- **Administrative metadata**	provides information on user rights and management of digital objects	 such as license, rights management,  and access control.
	
- **Data organisation**
	If you want your research data to be easily traced and interpreted, the folder structure and the file names used for the data files should be logical. Its also a good practice to note the file naming and its meaning in a readme.txt file.
 - **Data anonymization**
Before you upload the files you should check whether they contain privacy-sensitive information within the meaning of the [Dutch Personal Data Protection Act] (http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/dataprotection/national%20laws/NL_DP_LAW.pdf). 
If you give access to the data, they must be completely anonimyzed. 
## Depositing data To deposite data, you should login as a registered user. In the main page click on "Deposit now". Depositing data in Repository service is a 6 step process. 

*  **Step 1: Select and upload files to deposit**
	
	In this step you should provide the files and general information about your deposit. You first need to select the files and then upload them. Make sure that you are uploading an acceptable file format. See [SURFsara acceptable formats](http://datasupport.researchdata.nl/en/start-de-cursus/iii-onderzoeksfase/dataformaten/preferred-formats/).
	If the data format you are trying to upload is not supported, you can always contact us for support. 

	Then enter the general information that is required (Title, Creator and Description). These information will be the basic  metadata for the files. THe fields with * are compolsury.

* **Step 2: Select a community, collection and/or metadata schema**
	If you are a memeber of a community and you want to deposit data in that community, select the community name.
	The collection and metadata schema will be prepopulated based on which community you choose. 
	If you are not member of any communities, you will see the collections and schemas defined by yourself.
	This step os optional and can be skipped.

To find a data or metadata, use the search functionality on the home page. You can also see the latest deposits on the the top-right pannel in your homepage. 

  ![Alt Image Text](Screenshots/find_data.png)
If you have the PID (Persistent Identifer) of the data you can directly search in the [handle server](http://hdl.handle.net/) and get the url to the location of the data.
## Exporting metadataTo export metadata you should first find the data and then click on the export link on the top-right corner of the metadata pannel.
